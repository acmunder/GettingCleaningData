## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


### The "run_analysis.R" script executes the following steps:

1. Downloades and unzips and loads the required data.
2. Assigns column names.
3. Merges the training and the test data to create one data set.
4. Extracts all columns containing mean and standard deviation values for each    measurement (according to the column name).
5. Uses descriptive activity names for the activities in the data set.
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Sorts the output according to the subject number (or according to the 
activity, alternatively)
8. Creates a second, tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Each step is further explained in the script.


### The output of the "run_analysis.R" script is saved as "second_dataset.txt"


### "CodeBook.md" provides further information on this project.
